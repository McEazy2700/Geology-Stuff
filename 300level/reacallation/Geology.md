# Original Horizontality
Sediments are deposited in horizontal layers.

# Superposition
In a normal sequence of sedimentary rock or lava flow, the layer above is younger than
the layer below.

# Faunal Succession
Fossil assemblages occur in rocks in a definite and determinable order.

# Key Notes.
* The birth of the Earth: 4.5 billion years ago.
* Geologic time spans from the creation of the Earth some 4.5 billion years ago to today.
  and is chopped up into segments based on significant events that happened in the past.
* Generally accepted units for increasingly smaller units of time include eons, eras, periods and epochs.
* Different periods on the time scale are usually divided by major tectonic or paleontological events.


### Crystal Chemistry
* Crystalline solids are those which show long-range order in their internal arrangement of atoms
  or molecules, which is repeated in all directions.
