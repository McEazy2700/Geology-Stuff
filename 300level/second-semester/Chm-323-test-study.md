# Spectroscopy
Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between light and matter. It involves using tools like a spectrometer,
to measure the amount of light that is absorbed, transmitted or emitted by a substance at different wavelengths. This
information can be used to identify the composition and structure of a substance as well as its physical and chemical
properties.

## UV Spectroscopy
UV-Spectroscopy uses light in the ultra-violet and visible range of the spectrum to study the properties of a substance.
In UV-Spectroscopy, the sample is placed in a spectrometer that produces light in the UV and visible regions and measures
the amount of light that is absorbed by the sample.  

UV-Spectroscopy mainly utilized electromagnetic radiation ranging from $200\mu m\ -\ 800\mu m$ in the electromagnetic
spectrum. Visible light is found between $400\mu m\ -\ 800\mu m$, while from $200\mu m\ -\ 400\mu m$ are the UV-radiations.

When light is absorbed by a molecule, it can cause the molecule to vibrate, rotate or change its electronic structure.
These changes result in the absorption of specific wavelengths of light, which can be measured by a spectrometer.  
The absorption of light is governed by the principle of quantum mechanics which states that the energy of a photon of light
is quantized, which means it can only exist at discrete energy levels. Thus when a photon of light is absorbed by a
molecule, it causes the molecule to transition to a higher energy state. The difference between the excited state and the
ground state is the wavelength of light that was absorbed.  

When a photon of light is absorbed by a molecule, it can cause the molecule to behave in various ways. It can cause the
molecule to vibrate leading to the absorption of infrared light, it can cause the molecule to rotate leading to the
absorption of micro-waves, and it can cause the molecule to change its electronic structure leading to the absorption of UV rays.

### How UV-Spectroscopy works
In a UV spectrometer, there is a light source, which might radiate many wavelengths of light. In from of the source is a
Mono-Chromator, which separates the wavelengths of the light into single beams. In front of the Mono-Chromator is a beam 
separator, that separates those beams, and guides the into two separate directions.

### Pros and Cons of UV-Spectroscopy
#### Cons
* Many molecules have similar bonding, and so an analysis of the using UV-spectroscopy will yield a similar result, so it's not used
to get the specific composition of a molecule
