Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between light and matter. It involves using tools like a spectrometer,
to measure the amount of light that is absorbed, transmitted or emitted by a substance at different wavelengths. This
information can be used to identify the composition and structure of a substance as well as its physical and chemical
properties.

## UV Spectroscopy
UV-Spectroscopy uses light in the ultra-violet and visible range of the spectrum to study the properties of a substance.
In UV-Spectroscopy, the sample is placed in a spectrometer that produces light in the UV and visible regions and measures
the amount of light that is absorbed by the sample.  

UV-Spectroscopy mainly utilized electromagnetic radiation ranging from $200\mu m\ -\ 800\mu m$ in the electromagnetic
spectrum. Visible light is found between $400\mu m\ -\ 800\mu m$, while from $200\mu m\ -\ 400\mu m$ are the UV-radiations
UV radiations have wavelengths ranging from 190nm - 300nm.

When light is absorbed by a molecule, it can cause the molecule to vibrate, rotate or change its electronic structure.
These changes result in the absorption of specific wavelengths of light, which can be measured by a spectrometer.  
The absorption of light is governed by the principle of quantum mechanics which states that the energy of a photon of light
is quantized, which means it can only exist at discrete energy levels. Thus when a photon of light is absorbed by a
molecule, it causes the molecule to transition to a higher energy state. The difference between the excited state and the
ground state is the wavelength of light that was absorbed.  

When a photon of light is absorbed by a molecule, it can cause the molecule to behave in various ways. It can cause the
molecule to vibrate leading to the absorption of infrared light, it can cause the molecule to rotate leading to the
absorption of micro-waves, and it can cause the molecule to change its electronic structure leading to the absorption of UV rays.

### How UV-Spectroscopy works
In a UV spectrometer, there is a light source, which might radiate many wavelengths of light. In from of the source is a
Mono-Chromator, which separates the wavelengths of the light into single beams. In front of the Mono-Chromator is a beam 
separator, that separates those beams, and guides the into two separate directions.  

UV-visible spectroscopy is mainly used for identifying conjugate systems that tend to have stronger absorption.
Molecules that absorb UV rays are called **Chromophores**.

#### Beer-Lambert Law
$$A = ε.cl$$
where:
* A is the absorbance of UV light
* ε is the molar absorptivity
* c is the concentration of the sample
* l is the path length

### Pros and Cons of UV-Spectroscopy
#### Cons
* Many molecules have similar bonding, and so an analysis using UV-spectroscopy will yield a similar result, so it's not used
to get the specific composition of a molecule

## NMR Spectroscopy
NMR means Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. It is used to:
* Determine the structure of molecules
Analyze the purity of chemicals

### Principles of NMR
When a nucleus that possesses a magnetic moment(nuclei with odd mass or odd atomic numbers such as hydrogen $^1$H, or carbon $^{13}$C
nucleus) is placed in a strong
magnetic field, it will begin to precess at a particular speed like a spinning top. This precession is the fundamental
attribute of a nucleus that allows us to use NMR.  
If the sample placed in the strong magnetic field is irradiated with radio waves at the same frequency, as the procession
frequency, an NMR spectrum can be obtained. This is a result of the radio waves causing the nucleus to spin to flip
parallel to the radio waves.  
The higher the external magnetic field, the higher the energy required to cause this spin flip.  
The nuclei eventually return to their low-level spin state parallel to the magnetic field, in the process of which they
induce a radio signal in the output circuit. A Fourier analysis(or transform) is then performed on that radio signal to give us
our spectrum.
> **Magnetic moment:** also knowm as magnetic dipole, is a measure of an object's tendency to align with a magnetic field.  
> **Precession:** a slow movement of the axis of a spinning body around another axis due to a torque acting to chang the first axis.

### NMR Spectrum
* An NMR spectrum is a plot of the radio frequency against the absorption
* A signal in the spectrum is referred to as resonance.

### NMR Properties
### Chemical Shift
Chemical shift refers to a measure of the change in resonance frequency of a nucleus relative to a reference frequency.  
The chemical shift in absolute terms is the frequency of the resonance expressed concerning a standard compound which 
is defined at 0ppm
$$chemical\ shift = \frac{frequency\ of\ signal - frequency\ of\ reference}{spectrometer\ frequency} \times 10^6$$

### Shielding
Shielding refers to a phenomenon where electrons shield the nucleus from the external magnetic field. This reduces the
strength of the magnetic field experienced by the nucleus, which in turn affects the resonance frequency of the nucleus
and causes it to resonate slightly differently than it would normally.

### Deshielding
Deshielding refers to a phenomenon where electrons do not shield the nucleus from the external magnetic field. This increases
the strength of the magnetic field experienced by the nucleus, which in turn affects the resonance frequency of the nucleus
and causes it to resonate slightly differently than it would normally.

> The electrons around the proton create a magnetic field that opposes the applied field(external magnetic field). Since
thi reduces the the field experienced by the nucleus, the electron in said to shield the nucleus.

### Causes of Shielding & Deshielding
Some of the common causes of deshielding in NMR include:
* The presence of electro-negative atoms such as O$_2$ or F$_2$ can pull the electrons(shielding the nucleus) away
  from the nucleus thus reducing the effectiveness of shielding.
* The geometry of the atom and the distribution of electrons within the atom can hamper or improve the shielding of the nucleus.
  For example, a cubic atom may have more shielding than a hexagonal atom.
* The magnitude of the electromagnetic field can affect the energy levels of the nucleus and the ability to cancel out the
  field.

### Coupling in NMR
NMR spectrums usually have peaks that appear as a group of peaks due to coupling with neighboring protons. This occurs when the
magnetic nuclei of certain atoms influence the magnetic nuclei of atoms around them.  
Equivalent protons do not show coupling with each other. If the neighbors are not equivalent, then more complex patterns arise.

### TMS
TMS or tetramethylsilane is a commonly used reference substance in NMR spectroscopy
