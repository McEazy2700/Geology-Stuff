#### What is Spectroscopy?

According to the above video, the origin of spectroscopy was from matter, when we were trying to study the interaction,
between matter and electromagnetic radiation. The two most important words here are **_matter_** and **_electromagnetic radiation_**.

> According to [pasco.com](https://www.pasco.com/products/guides/what-is-spectroscopy), Spectroscopy is the investigation and 
measurement of the spectra produced by matter interacting with or emitting electromagnetic radiation.

This basically relies on the fact that, when matter interacts with EMRs (electromagnetic radiation), even if the matter is
transparent, not all the radiation passes through or is reflected (as in oblique matter), some of the radiation is absorbed 
by said matter, and that leads to the remaining radiation that is reflected or that passes through to have holes or variations in 
it's spectra.
Spectroscopy studies these residual emissions as it is unique for various elements and compound.  

During a spectroscopy experiment, EMR of a specified wavelength range is passed from a source through a sample containing compounds of
interest, resulting in either absorption or emission taking place. During absorption, the sample absorbs energy from the light source,
while during emission, the sample emits light of a different wavelength.  

In absorption spectroscopy, the sample compounds are excited, by the EMR provided by the light source, their molecules absorb energy
from the EMR, become excited and jump to a higher energy excited state from the stable, low energy ground state. A detector, usually 
a photodiode, usually on the opposite side of the sample, records the samples absorption of wavelengths, and determines the extent of
their absorption.
> The spectrum of a samples absorbed wavelength is know as it's absorption spectrum.  
Each molecule within a sample will only absorb wavelengths, with energy levels equal to the energy level it needs to go from the ground state
to the excited state. This means that each molecule will continue to allow all wavelengths to pass through it until it can absorb 
radiation from a wavelength that corresponds to Î”E, which is the difference between it's energy level in the excited and it's energy
level in the ground state.


#### What is Spectroscopy Used for?
Spectroscopy is used in Chemistry (and potentially Geology) to detect and determine the structural composition of a sample. As I stated 
above each type of atom or molecule, will absorb or emit EMR in it's own characteristic way that is unique to itself. Therefore, spectroscopy
uses this characteristics to detect and analyse the composition of a sample.
