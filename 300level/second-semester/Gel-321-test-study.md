# Metamorphic Petrology

## Metamorphism and Metamorphic Rocks
### What is Metamorphism
Metamorphism in my definition is the solid-state physical or chemical (or both) alteration of pre-existing rocks(igneous,
sedimentary or metamorphic) as a result of changing physical (such as temperature or pressure) or chemical (such as chemically active
fluids) conditions or both leading to the formation of metamorphic rocks.

### Metamorphic Rock
Metamorphic rock is a rock that has been altered physically or chemically (or both) in the solid state as a result of changing
physical or chemical conditions (from the ones under which it formed and is stable) leading to structural rearrangement or
formation of new minerals.
