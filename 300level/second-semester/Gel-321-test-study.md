## Metamorphism and Metamorphic Rocks
### What is Metamorphism
Metamorphism in my definition is the solid-state physical or chemical (or both) alteration of pre-existing rocks(igneous,
sedimentary or metamorphic) as a result of changing physical (such as temperature or pressure) or chemical (such as chemically active
fluids) conditions or both leading to the formation of metamorphic rocks.

### Metamorphic Rock
Metamorphic rock is a rock that has been altered physically or chemically (or both) in the solid state as a result of changing
physical or chemical conditions (from the ones under which it formed and is stable) leading to structural rearrangement or
formation of new minerals.

### Factors affecting Metamorphism
* The chemical composition of the parent rock.
* The temperature at which metamorphism takes place.
* The amount and type of pressure felt during metamorphism.
* The amount of and type of fluid present during metamorphism.
The amount of time over which metamorphism occurs.

#### Chemical composition of the parent rock.
Parent rock can be any of the three types of rock (igneous, sedimentary and even metamorphic). One of the most
critical features of parent rock is its mineral composition, as the stability of different minerals under different
conditions is what dictates which minerals are formed during metamorphism, as under the same changing physical
and chemical conditions some minerals could undergo chemical reactions leading to the formation of new minerals,
whilst some others may just change their size and shape.

#### Temperature
The temperature at which metamorphism occurs is another vital factor that affects the resulting metamorphic rocks
formed. Minerals are stable over a specific temperature range, and this range varies from mineral to mineral.
Quartz for example is stable from surface temperature to over 1800&deg;C, while most common minerals have an
upper limit between 150&deg;C and 1000&deg;C.  
Some minerals will change their crystal structure depending on the temperature and pressure. Quartz itself has
different polymorphs that are stable between 0&deg;C and 1800&deg;C. The minerals Kyanite, Andalusite and Sillimanite
are polymorphs with the composition $Al_2SiO_5$. The fact that they are stable under different pressures and temperature
means that their presence can be used to determine the temperatures and pressures at which a metamorphic rock containing
them formed.

#### Pressure
Pressure implies the temperature at which minerals are stable, in the case of Quartz as the pressure
increases, so does the upper limit of stability. Another important effect of pressure on metamorphic rocks is
texture. When **differential stress** is applied to a rock, it's elongated in the areas with
less stress, while shear stress leads to diagonal stretching in the rock, while **shear stress** leads to diagonal
stretching in the rock. However, in both cases, rocks become foliated.
> Differential strees: Stress applied at right angle in all directions, but with one direction experiencing more
  pressue than others.  
> Shear stress: stress applied at an angle.  
> Foliation: alignment of minerals in a particular direction in a rock.

#### Fluids
Water is the main fluid present in rocks, however other fluids like CO$_2$ can be found. Fluids affect metamorphism
in three main ways. First, they facilitate the movement of ions between minerals, therefore increasing the rate at which
reactions take place, and metamorphism occurs.  
They also in their liquid form during their movement in the crust, transport and concentrate dissolved from one place
to another.  
Perhaps more importantly, fluids can also serve to reduce the upper limit of mineral stability.

#### Time
Time is a very important factor in metamorphism as metamorphism is a very slow process, the more time parent rocks spend
under metamorphic conditions, the more complete their metamorphism is.

## Metamorphic Grade
Metamorphic grade refers to the amount or degree of metamorphism a rock undergoes. It ranges from **log grade** (little
metamorphism) to **high grade** (high metamorphism).   
Low-grade metamorphism begins at temperatures just above sedimentary rock conditions. the sequence **slate -> phyllite ->
schist -> gneiss** represents increasing metamorphic grade.
We use **index minerals** that form at specific temperatures and pressures to identify metamorphic grades. They also provide
insight into the rock's protolith and the metamorphic conditions that created it. **chlorite -> muscovite -> biotite -> garnet
-> staurolite** are index minerals representing a respective sequence of low to high-grade rock.
