## Metamorphism and Metamorphic Rocks
### What is Metamorphism
Metamorphism in my definition is the solid-state physical or chemical (or both) alteration of pre-existing rocks(igneous,
sedimentary or metamorphic) as a result of changing physical (such as temperature or pressure) or chemical (such as chemically active
fluids) conditions or both leading to the formation of metamorphic rocks.

### Metamorphic Rock
Metamorphic rock is a rock that has been altered physically or chemically (or both) in the solid state as a result of changing
physical or chemical conditions (from the ones under which it formed and is stable) leading to structural rearrangement or
formation of new minerals.

### Factors affecting Metamorphism
* The chemical composition of the parent rock.
* The temperature at which metamorphism takes place.
* The amount and type of pressure felt during metamorphism.
* The amount of and type of fluid present during metamorphism.
The amount of time over which metamorphism occurs.

#### Chemical composition of the parent rock.
Parent rock can be any of the three types of rock (igneous, sedimentary and even metamorphic). One of the most
critical features of parent rock is its mineral composition, as the stability of different minerals under different
conditions is what dictates which minerals are formed during metamorphism, as under the same changing physical
and chemical conditions some minerals could undergo chemical reactions leading to the formation of new minerals,
whilst some others may just change their size and shape.

#### Temperature
The temperature at which metamorphism occurs is another vital factor that affects the resulting metamorphic rocks
formed. Minerals are stable over a specific temperature range, and this range varies from mineral to mineral.
Quartz for example is stable from surface temperature to over 1800&deg;C, while most common minerals have an
upper limit between 150&deg;C and 1000&deg;C.  
Some minerals will change their crystal structure depending on the temperature and pressure. Quartz itself has
different polymorphs that are stable between 0&deg;C and 1800&deg;C. The minerals Kyanite, Andalusite and Sillimanite
are polymorphs with the composition $Al_2SiO_5$. The fact that they are stable under different pressures and temperature
means that their presence can be used to determine the temperatures and pressures at which a metamorphic rock containing
them formed.

#### Pressure
Pressure implies the temperature at which minerals are stable, in the case of Quartz as the pressure
increases, so does the upper limit of stability. Another important effect of pressure on metamorphic rocks is
texture. When **differential stress** is applied to a rock, it's elongated in the areas with
less stress, while shear stress leads to diagonal stretching in the rock, while **shear stress** leads to diagonal
stretching in the rock. However, in both cases, rocks become foliated.
> Differential street: Stress applied at right angle in all directions, but with one direction experiencing more
  pressure than others.  
> Shear stress: stress applied at an angle.  
> Foliation: alignment of minerals in a particular direction in a rock.

#### Fluids
Water is the main fluid present in rocks, however other fluids like CO$_2$ can be found. Fluids affect metamorphism
in three main ways. First, they facilitate the movement of ions between minerals, therefore increasing the rate at which
reactions take place, and metamorphism occurs.  
They also in their liquid form during their movement in the crust, transport and concentrate dissolved from one place
to another.  
Perhaps more importantly, fluids can also serve to reduce the upper limit of mineral stability.

#### Time
This is a very important factor in metamorphism as metamorphism is a very slow process, the more time parent rocks spend
under metamorphic conditions, the more complete their metamorphism is.  
**Note**:** some types of metamorphic rocks such as quartzite and marble which also form in direct pressure zones
do not necessarily exhibit foliation, because their minerals do not tend to show alignment.

### Classification of Metamorphic Rock
Metamorphic rocks can be classified based on a variety of criteria including the type of metamorphism that took place,
texture, mineralogy and conditions under which they were formed.

#### Classification Based on the type of Metamorphism
There are three main types of metamorphism contact, regional and dynamic.

##### Contact Metamorphism
Contact metamorphism occurs when rocks are subjected to relatively high temperatures, at relatively low pressures. This
is typically due to magmatic intrusion in country rock. This kind of metamorphism occurs over a relatively small area
and is characterized by changing mineral assemblages representing the increase of temperature towards the intrusion.
It leads to the formation of rocks such as Hornfels and Skarn.

##### Regional Metamorphism
Occurs when rocks are subjected to high temperature and pressure over a large area usually due to tectonic activity. This
high temperature and pressure are usually a result of deep burial within the earth, which takes place around subduction
zones. This kind of metamorphism can lead to the formation of rocks like Gneiss, Schist and Marble.

#### Classification Based on Texture and Structure
Based on Texture and Structure Metamorphic rocks can be broadly classified into two types, foliated and non-foliated.
Non-foliated metamorphic rocks are formed when the pressure during formation is uniform or low (near the surface). They
can also form when the parent rock consists of blocky minerals such as Quartz and Calcite in which individual crystals
do not align because they are no longer in one direction than the other.
However, this distinction breaks down in areas of intense deformation where even minerals like Quartz can be squeezed into a
long stringer, much like squeezing toothpaste out of a tube.  
Foliated metamorphic rocks are those formed under high differential pressure (when pressure is higher in one direction than another)
causing crystals to squeeze and grow in a direction perpendicular to the higher stress.

##### Types of Foliated Metamorphic Rocks
Four common types of metamorphic rocks, listed in order of metamorphic grade are slate → phyllite → slate → gneiss
* Slate: Formed from the low-grade metamorphism of shale.
* Phyllite: Is similar to slate but has typically been heated to a higher temperature causing the mica to grow larger and
  leading to a satiny sheen on the surface
* Schist: Forms at higher temperatures and pressures, and thus exhibits mica crystals that are large enough to see without
  magnification. Individual crystal faces may flash when the sample is turned, causing the rock to appear shiny. Other
  minerals like garnet might also be present.
* Gneiss: Forms at the highest temperatures and pressures, and has crystals large enough to see with unaided eyes.
  Gneiss features minerals that have separated into bands of different colors. Gneiss usually contains little or no mica
  because they form at temperatures higher than those under which mica is stable.

##### Types of Non-Foliated Metamorphic Rocks
These are metamorphic rocks formed under low-pressure conditions or the effects of confining pressure (equal in all directions.
They are usually formed near the surface and are products of contact metamorphism. The following are examples of non-foliated
metamorphic rock in order of increasing grade. Marble → Quartzite → Hornfels
* Marble: Formed from the metamorphism of limestone. Forms pure white crystals if the parent limestone was pure, if not it could
  end up "marbled" in appearance.
* Quartzite: Metamorphosed sandstone. Is dominated by Quartz but may contain clay minerals.
* Hornfels: Formed from the metamorphism of fine-grained rocks like Murdock and volcanic rocks. The Hornfels usually appears
  to have gneiss-like bands but these reflect alternating sandstone and shale that were in the protolith and are not related
  to the alignment of crystals.

##### Migmatite both Metamorphic and Igneous
If a metamorphic rock is heated enough, it can begin to undergo partial melting in the same way that igneous rocks do. The more
felsic minerals (Feldspar and Quartz) will melt, while the more mafic minerals (Biotite and Hornblende) do not. When the melt
crystallizes again, the result is a light-colored igneous rock interspersed with a dark-colored metamorphic rock. This mixed rock
is called **Migmatite**.

## Metamorphic Grade
Refers to the amount or degree of metamorphism a rock undergoes. It ranges from **low grade** (little
metamorphism) to **high grade** (high metamorphism).   
Low-grade metamorphism begins at temperatures just above sedimentary rock conditions. The sequence **slate → phyllite →
schist → gneiss** represents increasing metamorphic grade.
We use **index minerals** that form at specific temperatures and pressures to identify metamorphic grades. They also provide
insight into the rock's protolith and the metamorphic conditions that created it. **Chlorite → Muscovite → biotite → garnet
→ staurolite** are all index minerals representing a respective sequence of low to high-grade rock.

## Metamorphic Facies
A Metamorphic Facie is a group of metamorphic rocks that formed under the same temperature and pressure conditions, but have
different protoliths.
High geothermal gradients such as those present around igneous intrusions, commonly result in metamorphic rocks belonging to the Hornfels
facies. Average geothermal gradients usually lead to the formation of metamorphic rocks from zeolite → green-schist → amphibole
→ eclogite facies. While low geothermal gradients found around oceanic crusts produce metamorphic rocks from zeolite → blue-schist
to eclogite facies.

### Indexes
If we know the facies of metamorphic rock in the region, we can tell the geothermal history of that region.

## Metamorphic Equilibria
This refers to the balance between the minerals and the conditions (temperature, pressure and chemical composition) in metamorphic
rock. When metamorphism takes place, minerals may react with each other and with surrounding fluids to form new minerals.
The conditions in which these reactions occur and the resulting metamorphic rocks are known as Metamorphic Equilibria.
Metamorphic Equilibria are important because they provide information about the conditions that rocks experience during metamorphism.

## Changes in Metamorphism (or associated with metamorphism)
There are several changes associated with metamorphism including changes in the composition, structure and texture of the rock.

### Compositional Changes
During metamorphism, the constituent minerals may change or recrystallize leading to changes in the chemical composition of the
rock. For example, limestone which is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of the mineral calcite can be metamorphosed

### Metamorphic Differentiation
Metamorphic Differentiation is similar to Metamorphism, but unlike metamorphism, it is a process that occurs in metamorphic rocks
where different materials within a rock begin to react with one another and with fluids present in the rock, leading to the formation
of new minerals. This process id is driven by changes in temperature and pressure, as well as by the presence of chemically active fluids  
There are so many ways in which metamorphic differentiation can occur.
* Through Contact metamorphism:
    In which rocks are subjected to high temperatures due to contact with magmatic intrusions.
* Through Regional metamorphism:
    In which rocks are subjected to high temperatures and pressures over a large area due to tectonic activity.
During metamorphic differentiation, the original minerals in the rock may be altered to form new minerals with different chemical
compositions. For example, Quartz may be transformed into the mineral Coesite through high temperature and pressure conditions.
Similarly, the mineral Feldspar can be transformed into the mineral Mica.  
Overall metamorphic differentiation is a complex process that can lead to the formation of new minerals, and the alteration of
existing ones within metamorphic rocks.

## Metasomatism
Metasomatism is a metamorphic process that leads to the chemical alteration of rocks in a manner that involves the introduction,
or removal of chemical components as a result of the interaction of the rock with chemically active fluids. Metasomatism takes place
in an open system, where mass can enter and leave.  
Metasomatic rocks, in general, have granofelsic or granoblastic structure.
### Types of Metasomatism
There are three main types of metasomatism.
* Hydrothermal Metasomatism: 
    Involves the alteration of rocks by hot chemical-rich fluids. This type of metasomatism can occur at different depths within the
    earth but is mainly associated with magmatic and tectonic activity. Chemically rich fluids may be produced during the cooling and
    solidification of magma. These fluids can then move through surrounding rocks altering their composition as they go. Hydrothermal
    metasomatism can also occur when rocks are subjected to high temperatures and pressures during metamorphism.
* Metamorphic Metasomatism:
    This kind of metasomatism occurs during metamorphic processes, where high temperatures and pressures can cause fluids to be released
    from rocks, these fluids can then go around altering the chemical and mineralogical composition of rocks.
* Sedimentary Metasomatism:
    This involves the alteration of sedimentary rocks due to the infiltration of fluids such as water or oil, which can change their
    chemical and mineralogical composition.
