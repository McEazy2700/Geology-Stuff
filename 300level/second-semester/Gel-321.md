### Definition of Metamorphism
To my understanding, metamorphism is the solid state physio-chemical (physical and chemical) alteration of structure
texture and composition of pre-existing rocks due to changing physical conditions (temperature and pressure) and the
presence of chemically active fluids.

Therefore, metamorphic rocks are rocks that have undergone alteration in their structure, texture or composition as
a result of changing physical conditions (temperature and pressure) and the presence of chemically active fluids.

### Types of Metamorphism  
There are two main types of Metamorphism:
1. Contact Metamorphism and
2. Regional Metamorphism
* In addition to these two main types, of metamorphism, we have various subtypes such as:
3. Dynamic Metamorphism
4. Hydrothermal Metamorphism and
5. Impact Metamorphism

#### Contact Metamorphism
To my understanding, contact metamorphism is a type of metamorphism that occurs primarily as a result of the increase in temperature
when differential stress is minor such as the intrusion of magma into pre-existing rock, this usually leads to metamorphism that
takes place over a relatively small area and is characterized by changing mineral assemblages that reflect the increase in temperature
towards the intrusion.  
Rocks formed from this type of metamorphism are usually non-foliated (due to the absence of differential stress) and fine-grained
(due to the short duration of the metamorphic processes).  

Examples of rocks that form through contact metamorphism are Hornfels (which form from the metamorphism of shale or mudstone),
Marble (which form from the metamorphism of limestone), Quartzite (which forms from the metamorphism of sandstone) and Schist
(which forms from the metamorphism of shale, mudstone, or other fine-grained sedimentary rock).

Any type of magma can lead to contact metamorphism. The type and intensity of the metamorphism and the width of the metamorphic 
**aureole** that develops around the magma body will depend on several factors, including the type of **country rock**, the 
temperature of the intruding body, the size of the body and the volatile compounds within the body.

> According to [encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/contact-aureole) 
and `aureole` or contact aureole (metamorphic aureole) refers to a region in which **country rock** surrounding an igneous intrusion 
has been recrystallized in response to the heat by the intrusion

> According to [encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/earth-and-environment/minerals-mining-and-metallurgy/metallurgy-and-mining-terms-and-concepts/country-rock#1O13countryrock), the term country rock refers to a body of rock that receives or hosts an intrusion or 
a viscous geologic material.


#### Dynamic Metamorphism

Dynamic Metamorphism results mainly from mechanical deformation, with little long-term temperature change,
in other words, pressure is the main driving force here (pun intended). The resulting textures of such rocks range from
breccias composed of angular shattered rock fragments, to very fine-grained granulated or powdered rocks, all of which
show obvious foliation.
> ![Depiction of dynamic metamorphism](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309424001/figure/fig6/AS:614348384907296@1523483477450/Dynamic-metamorphism.png)

Dynamic metamorphism is usually the result of shear stress, such as occurring along fault zones. Dynamic metamorphism occurs
at relatively low temperatures compared to other types of metamorphism. It affects a narrow region near the fault.

#### Regional Metamorphism
According to [dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/regional-metamorphism), regional metamorphism is a type of
metamorphism in which the mineralogy and texture of rocks are changed over a wide area by deep burial and heating associated with
large-scale forces of plate tectonics. According to [encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/regional-metamorphism), these changes or recrystallization occur in response to changes in temperature, lithostatic
pressure and in many cases shear stress occurring in the **_orogenic belt_**.
> According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orogenic_belt), an **orogenic belt**, or **orogen**, is a zone of the earths crust
affected by `orogeny`. An orogenic belt develops when a [continental plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_plate) crumples and is
if uplifted to form one or more mountain ranges; this involves series of geological processes collectively called orogenesis.

> [Orogeny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orogeny) is the primary mechanism by which mountains are formed on continents. This takes
place at a convergent plate margin(boundary) when plate motion compresses the margin. An orogenic belt or `orogen` develops as the
compressed plate crumples and is uplifted to form one or more mountain ranges.

|![Continental collision leading to the formation of orogen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Continental-continental_convergence_Fig21contcont_i18.png)| Continental collision of two continental plates to form a collisional orogen |

So in a nutshell regional metamorphism takes place over a wide area and is usually due to a combination of changes in temperature,
pressure and or differential stress. These changes take place in the orogenic belt or `orogen` which is a region formed when plates
collide resulting in both high pressures and high temperatures. Regional metamorphism may also include extreme conditions where partial melting occurs called `anatexis`.

### Factors Affecting Metamorphism
There are several factors affecting the intensity and extent of metamorphism in rocks, these factors include
* Pressure
* Temperature
* Chemically active Fluids
* Composition and Structure of Parent rock (Protolith)

#### Pressure
Pressure is one of the most important factors affecting metamorphism. The type of pressure be it confining pressure
(the type of pressure that is exerted equally on all sides of the rock) or differential pressure (the type of pressure
that is exerted on the rock from different directions) and the amount of pressure all affect the resulting metamorphic
rock in different ways. 
* In general, the higher the pressure the more intense the metamorphism
* Higher pressure causes the rock to become denser and more resistant to weathering and erosion
* It can also cause the mineral within the rock to recrystallize leading to the formation of new minerals or the alteration
  of existing ones.
* The type of pressure is also important as confining pressure causes the rock to be more compact, and deform uniformly, leading to
  the formation of foliated metamorphic rock
* Differentiation pressure on the other hand can cause the rock to deform and shear in different directions, leading to
  the formation of non-foliated metamorphic rock with a more homogeneous composition.
* The amount of pressure can also affect the rate at which metamorphism occurs, as higher pressure can lead minerals to
  undergo chemical reactions and recrystallize more quickly, leading to the formation of metamorphic rock in a shorter amount
  of time

#### Temperature
Higher Temperature also generally means more intense metamorphism as heat causes the minerals in rocks to undergo chemical
reactions and recrystallize.
* The type of rock also plays a big role when it comes to temperature as some rocks are more stable at higher temperatures
  than others.
* In addition to the rock type, the duration for which the rocks are exposed to high temperatures plays an important role,
  in general, the longer a rock spends under high temperatures, the more intense its metamorphism will be, this is
  because the heat has more time to cause them to undergo chemical reactions and recrystallize.
