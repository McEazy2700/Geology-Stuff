#### Definition of Metamorphism
According [Britanica](https://www.britannica.com/science/metamorphic-rock), a metamorphic rock,
is any class of rock that results from the **alteration** of a preexisting rock in response to **changing
environmental conditions such as variations in temperature, pressure and mechanical stress**.
> This means a rock that has been altered as a result of changing environmental conditions (can be any
combination of temperature, pressure and mechanical stress), below the subsurface area or of weathering and 
diagenesis is a Metamorphic rock.  

This alteration process is known as **Metamorphism**
> The word [_metamorphism_](https://www.britannica.com/science/metamorphism) is derived from the Greek word
"change form"; Metamorphic rocks are derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks that have altered their form
(recrystallized) as a result of changes in their physical environment. Metamorphism comprises changes both in
mineralogy and fabric of the `Protholith` (parent rock).

Metamorphism is the **mineralogical** and **structural adjustment of solid rock** to physical and chemical conditions
differing from those under which the rock originally formed.

#### Types of Metamorphism

###### Dynamic Metamorphism
Dynamic Metamorphism or cataclasis results mainly from mechanical deformation, with little long term temperature change,
in other words pressure is the main driving force here (pun intended). The resulting textures of such rocks range from
breccias composed of angular shattered rock fragments, to very fine grained granulated or powdered rocks, all of which
show obvious foliation.

Dynamic metamorphism is usually the result of shear stress, such as occurs along fault zones. Dynamic metamorphism occurs
at relatively low temperatures compared to other types of metamorphism. It affects a narrow region near the fault.
