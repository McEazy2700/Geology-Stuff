#### Definition of Metamorphism
According to [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/metamorphic-rock), metamorphic rock is any class of rock that results from the **alteration** of a preexisting rock in response to **changing
environmental conditions such as variations in temperature, pressure and mechanical stress**.
> This means a rock that has been altered as a result of changing environmental conditions (can be any
combination of temperature, pressure and mechanical stress), below the subsurface area or of weathering and 
diagenesis is a Metamorphic rock.  

This alteration process is known as **Metamorphism**
> The word [_metamorphism_](https://www.britannica.com/science/metamorphism) is derived from the Greek word
"change form"; Metamorphic rocks are derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks that have altered their form
(recrystallized) as a result of changes in their physical environment. Metamorphism comprises changes both in
mineralogy and fabric of the `Protholith` (parent rock).

Metamorphism is the **mineralogical** and **structural adjustment of solid rock** to physical and chemical conditions
differing from those under which the rock originally formed.

### Types of Metamorphism  

#### Dynamic Metamorphism

Dynamic Metamorphism or cataclasis results mainly from mechanical deformation, with little long-term temperature change,
in other words, pressure is the main driving force here (pun intended). The resulting textures of such rocks range from
breccias composed of angular shattered rock fragments, to very fine-grained granulated or powdered rocks, all of which
show obvious foliation.

Dynamic metamorphism is usually the result of shear stress, such as occurring along fault zones. Dynamic metamorphism occurs
at relatively low temperatures compared to other types of metamorphism. It affects a narrow region near the fault.

#### Contact Metamorphism

Contact metamorphism occurs primarily as a consequence of the increase in temperature when the differential stress is minor.
A common occurrence of this is the effect produced adjacent to igneous intrusions where several metamorphic zones, represented 
by changing mineral assemblages reflect the increase in temperature towards the intrusion. The resulting rocks have equi-dimensional
(non-foliated) grains because of the lack of stress and are usually fine-grained due to the short duration of metamorphism

In a nutshell: Contact metamorphism happens when a body of magma intrudes into the upper part of the crust. Heat is important in
contact metamorphism, but pressure is not a key factor and because of this, contact metamorphism produces non-foliated rocks 
such as hornfels, marble and quartzite.

Any type of magma can lead to contact metamorphism. The type and intensity of the metamorphism and the width of the metamorphic 
**aureole** that develops around the magma body will depend on several factors, including the type of **country rock**, the 
temperature of the intruding body, the size of the body and the volatile compounds within the body.

> According to [encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/contact-aureole) 
and `aureole` or contact aureole (metamorphic aureole) refers to a region in which **country rock** surrounding an igneous intrusion 
has been recrystallized in response to the heat by the intrusion

> According to [encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/earth-and-environment/minerals-mining-and-metallurgy/metallurgy-and-mining-terms-and-concepts/country-rock#1O13countryrock), the term country rock refers to a body of rock that receives or hosts an intrusion or 
a viscous geologic material.


#### Regional Metamorphism
According to [dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/regional-metamorphism), regional metamorphism is a type of
metamorphism in which the mineralogy and texture of rocks are changed over a wide area by deep burial and heating associated with
large-scale forces of plate tectonics. According to [encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/regional-metamorphism), these changes or recrystallization occur in response to changes in temperature, lithostatic
pressure and in many cases shear stress occurring in the **_orogenic belt_**.
> According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orogenic_belt), an **orogenic belt**, or **orogen**, is a zone of the earths crust
affected by `orogeny`. An orogenic belt develops when a [continental plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_plate) crumples and is
if uplifted to form one or more mountain ranges; this involves series of geological processes collectively called orogenesis.

> [Orogeny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orogeny) is the primary mechanism by which mountains are formed on continents. This takes
place at a convergent plate margin(boundary) when plate motion compresses the margin. An orogenic belt or `orogen` develops as the
compressed plate crumples and is uplifted to form one or more mountain ranges.

So in a nutshell regional metamorphism takes place over a wide area and is usually due to a combination of changes in temperature,
pressure and or differential stress. These changes take place in the orogenic belt or `orogen` which is a region formed when plates
collide resulting in both high pressures and high temperatures. Regional metamorphism may also include extreme conditions where partial melting occurs called `anatexis`.
