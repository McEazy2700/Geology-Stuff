## Introduction to remote sensing
### What is Remote Sensing?
Remote sensing is the science of collecting data about an object (in our case the Earth) without actually
making contact with said object (from a distance). This is done by sensing and recording reflected and 
emited energy, and processing, analysing and applying that information.

### Elements of Remote Sensing.
Various systems (imaging systems) are setup to carry out success full remote sensing operations. These systems
are usually composed of the following elements. 
The elements of remote sensing in most cases consist of the following steps.
* Energy Source of Illumination
* Radiation and the Atmosphere
* Interaction of radiation with the target
* Recording of radiation (energy) by the sensors.
* Transmission, reception and processing of the recorded radiation.
* Interpretation and analysis of recieved readings.
* Application of the interpreted data.

#### Energy Source of Illumination
This energy to illuminate the object can come from various sources, most times the sun is the source, but energy
can also beemited from satellites.

#### Radiation and the Atmosphere
The energy (radiation) from the source on it's way to the object, will come in contact and interact with the
atmosphere in various ways. This interaction will also take place when the radiation reflected from the object
travels to the detectors.

#### Interaction of radiation with the target
When the radiation of from the source hits the object, they undergo various interactions depending on the object
or the type of radiation. After the interaction, a reflected ray sould be sent back to the sensors for recording.

#### Recording of radiation data by sensors.
The satellites possess specialized sensors that detect the reflected radiation and storage devices that store the
acquired data.

#### Transmission, reception and processing
The data cannot remain on the satellites as they need to study other plcaes as well, so the data is transmitted to
a ground station where it is recieved, cleaned and processed waiting for further analysis.

#### Interpretation and analysis
The processed data is the analysed and interpreted by professionals (remote sensing geologists etc.) and are then
ready to be applied in various fields.

#### Application of interpreted data
The information gathered can now be applied to fields like hazard mitigation, economic planning etc.


## Electromagnetic Radiation
The light or energy source that is a core element of remote sensing are form of electromagnetic radiation. 
An electromagnetic radiation consist of an electrical field which varies in magnitude perpedicular to the direction
of the wave, and a magnetic field oriented at right angle to the electrical field. Both of these fields travel at
the speed of light. 
Two properties of electromagnetic waves are important in remote sensing. These are wavelength and frequency.
* The *WaveLength* is the length of one complete wave cycle, or can be defined as the distance between successive
  wave crests.
* The *Frequency* of an electromagnetic wave is the number of complete wave cycles in one second. 

WaveLength and frequency are related by the formula $c = \lambda v$  
where:
  > c = the speed of light  
  > $\lambda$ = the wavelength  
  > v = frequency
* WaveLength and frequency are inversely related, the higher the wavelength, the lower the frequency.

### Electromagnetic Spectrum
Electromagnetic magnetic radiation are grouped based on their wavelength and frequency, this groups make up the
electromagnetic spectrum. Some bands in the spectrum are more suitable for remote sensing than others.

#### Key points about the electromagnetic spectrum
* The UV (Ultra-violet) region of the spectrum has the shortest wavelength which is generally suitable for remote sensing.
* The visible light regiion covers a range of approximately 0.4 to 0.7 $\mu m$.
* The visible region of the spectrum is the only region that can be associated with the concept of colors.
* Blue green and red are the primary colors that can be mixed in various proportions to form other colors.
* The infrared ocupies the range from 0.7 to 100 $\mu m$.
* Infrered in the spectrum can be split into two type. **Thermal (emited) Infrared** and **Reflected Infrared**.
* The reflected infrared is used in remote sensing.
* The microwave region of the spectrum is of more recent interest in remote sensing.

### Interaction with the Atmosphere
Particles and gasses in the atmosphere can affect in coming radiation. This effects come in the form of scattering and
absorbtion

#### Scattering
Scattering occurs when particles in the atmosphere cause the radiation to change direction from their initial direction.

There are three types of scattering which take place:
* **Rayleigh Scattering** occurs when the particles in the atmosphere are very small (e.g. Nitrogen and Oxygen molecules)
  compared to the wavelengths of the radiation leading to radiation of smaller wavelengths beign scattered more than
  particles of larger wavelength.
  * Rayleigh scattering is the dominant mechanism in the upper atmosphere.
  * The scky appearing blue during the day is as a result of this phenomenon.

* **Mie Scattering** occurs when the particles in the atmosphere are about the same size (e.g. dust, pollen and water vapour)
  as the wavelength of the radiation passing through.
  * This scattering tends to affect more larger wavelength radiation than Rayleigh.
  * It occurs mostly in the lower part of the atmosphere, where larger particles are more abundant.

* **Non selective scattering** occurs when the particles in the atmosphere are much more larger (e.g. water droplets and large
  dust particles) than the wavelengths of passing radiation.
  * In non selective scattering, all wavelengths are scattered equally.
  * This is the reason fog and clouds appear white to our eyes.

#### Absorbtion
This phenomenon causes molecules in the atmosphere (Ozone, CO<sub>2</sub> and water vapour) to absorb energy at different
wavelengths. Ozone CO<sub>2</sub> and water vapour are the three main the three main atmospheric constituents which absorb
radiation.
* **Ozone** absorbs the most harful (to most living things) ultraviolet radiation from the sun.
* **CO<sub>2</sub>** tends to absorb radiation in the infrared region of the spectrum which traps this heat in the atmosphere.
* **Water vapour** absorbs infrared and microwave radiation between 22 $\mu m$ and 1m.
* Since various molecules affect radiation in different ways, they influence where in the spectrum we can look for remote sensing
  pruposes.
* The areas of the spectrum not affected the least by atmospheric molecules are called the **atmospheric windows**

### Interaction with targets
There are three main ways incident radiation can interact with a target object.
* Absorbtion
* Transmition (Passes through)
* Reflection
In remote sensing, we are interestd in the reflected radiation from targets. There are two main ways energy is reflected
from targets:
* Specular reflection and
* Diffues reflection
#### Secular reflection
This is the kind of reflection that occurs when an object is smooth and mirror-like so all (or almost all) incident radiation
on that object is directed away from the object in a single direction.

#### Diffuse reflection
This kind of reflection occurs when a surface is rough, and energy is reflected almost uniformly in all directions.

Whether a surface reflects light specularly or diffusely depends on the smoothness/roughness of the surface and the
wavelength of the incoming radiation. If the wavelength is much smaller than the particle sizes on the targe, the difuse
reflection will dominate.

### Passive and Active remote sensing
* The sun's energy is **reflected** on by the object for vissible radiation, and is absorbed and **re-emitted** for
  thermal infrared radiation.
* Remote sensing systems which measure energy that is naturally available (e.g. the sus) are called **Passive sensors**.
* Passive sensors only work when raturally occuring energy is available (therefor useless at night).
* Thermal infrared that is absorbed and emitted later can work at night though.
* **Active sensors** on the other hand emit their own radiation on the target, and then measure the reflected radiation.
* Active sensors can be used for measuring wavelengths that are not sufficiently provided by the sun e.g. microwaves.

#### Characteristics of images
Electromagnetic radiation can be recorded in one of two ways, *photographically* or *electronically*
* The photographic method use chemical reactions on the process of light sensitive film to detect and record energy variations.
* The record is called a **photograph**
* In remote sensing, an *image* is different from a *photograph* in that an image represents any pictorial repesentation,
  regardles of whic electromagnetic radiation or what remote sensing device was used to detect and record the image.
* A photograph on the other hand, refers to images that have been detected and recorded on photographic film.
* Based on the above information we can say, all photographs are images, but not all images are not photographs.
* A photograph can be represented and stored in digital format, by subdividing images into small equal sized and shaped
  areas called *picture element* or **pixel** which is asigned a digital number representing it's brightness.

## Remote sensing basic concepts
### Satellites
Satellites are objects which revolve around another object (in this case the Earth), the moon is a natural satellite, and
man made satellites are those launched into space.
#### Satellite Characteristics: Orbit and Swaths
* The path followed by a satellite is known as it's **orbit**.
* Satellite orbits are mathed to the capabilities of it's sensor, and it's objective.
* Satellites at very high altitudes which view the same portion of the Earth are all times are said to have (or be in)
  **geostationary orbit**.
* Satellites in **geostationary orbit** revolve at speeds which match the rotation of the Earth so they seem stationary
  relative to the Earth's surface.
* Weather and communication satellites are usually geostationary.
* Some satellites follow **sun-synchronous** orbits, this ensures that they are in sync with the sun, and that at any given
  lattitude, the position of the sun in the sky will be the same at the same time in the same season. This allows for
  consistent illumination.
* **sun-synchronous** satellites are important for monitoring changes between images.
* Most satellites to day are in **Near polar** orbit. Which means they revolve north to south arround the Earth and with the
  rotation of the Earth east to west, the can cover the whole Earth.

### Resolution
#### Spatial resolution
The **spatial resolution** of an image refers to the size of the smallest possible feature that can be detected, and
determines the amount of detail that can be seen in an image. 
For example, from the international space station, a building on land might be detected as a single dot, so the size of
the building can be the spatial resolution, since anything smaller than the building will be to small to detect.

* The spatial resolution is also dependent on the Instantaneous Field Of View (IFOV).

> **IFOV** refers to the angular cone visibility of a sensor, and can be defined as the area of the Earth's surface
  which is visible from a particular altitude at a particular point in time.

* The size of the area viewed can be determined by multiplying the IFOV with the distance from the Earth to the sensor.
* This size on the ground is refered to as the **resolution cell** and determines a sensor's maximum spatial resolution.
* The term **pixel** is short for **picture element** and is the smallest unit of an image.
* Images where only large feature are visible are said to be **coarse or low resolution**. The smaller the objects that
  can be detected on an image, the higher the resolution.
* However, the higher the resolution, the less total ground area can be seen.

#### Scale
The ratio of the distance on an image or map to actual ground distance is called **scale**.
* A scale of 1:100,000 means that an object of 1cm width on the map will actually be 100,000cm (1km) wide on the ground.
* Maps or images with small "map-to-ground-rations" are reffered to as small sacale images/maps (e.g. 1:100,000), while
  those with larger ratios are called large scale images/maps (e.g. 1:5,000).

#### Spectral resolution
**Spectral resolution** refers to the ability of a sensor to detect fine wavelength intervals.
In simple terms, it refers to how finely a sensor can detect colors (except colors only apply to wavelengths in the
vissible light region, so you should probably use "fine wavelength intervals" instead).

* For example, black and white film record wavelengths extending to all or nearly all of the visible portion of the
  electromagnetic spectrum, so the have a **coarse or low spectal resolution** because the various wavelengths of the
  visible region cannot be individually distinguished from the images (i.e. no colors).
* **Multi-spectral sensors** can record energy over a variety of spectal wavelength ranges, and at several spectral
  resolutions.
* Even more advanced than the multi-spectral sensors are the **hyperspectral** sensors which can detect hundreds of
  very narrow spectral bands throughout the visible, near-infrared and mid-infrared portions of the spectrum.
* High spectral resolution can help us to detect fine differences between objects on an image basses on their spectral
  response in each narrow band (color).

#### Radiometric resolution
Radiometric resolution reffers to the magnitude of electromagnetic radiation that a sensor is sensitive to. This translates
to the ability of the sensor to discrimiate very slight differences in energy.
* Low radimetric sensors will tend to average out areas on a image, and are not very accurate as to what is represented on
  the image.
