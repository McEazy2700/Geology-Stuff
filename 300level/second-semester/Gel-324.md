## What is geo-physics
Geo-Physics is the study of the Earth and its structure using mathematical methods, the knowledge
of physics and the knowledge of geology.  
Geo-Physics can also be defined as a branch of science, that applies the principles of geology,
physics and mathematics to interpret the Earth's physical processes and phenomena.  

**Some key areas of study in geo-physics include:**  
* Seismology: the study of earthquakes and other types of ground motion.
* Geodesy: the study of the shape and size of the earth and gravitational field.
* Geomagnetism: the study of Earth's magnetic field.
