# Introduction to GeoChemistry

## Course Outline
* Definition, development, branches and application.
* Abundances, classificaion and distribution of elements in
  the earch system (lithosphere, hydrosphere, athmostphere and meteorites)
* Dispersion of elements - primary and secondary dispersion patterns.
* Geochemical environments (surficial and deep seated).
* Geochemistry of igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.
* Isotope GeoChemistry (stable isotope fraction (H, O, N, S, C)) and the delta notation.
* Application of stable isotopes in geological science.
* Radiactive isotope, (the radiactive decay series of U, Th and K).
* Application of radiactive isotopes in geotechnology.
