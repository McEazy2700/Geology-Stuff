## Course Outline
* Definition, development, branches and application.
* Abundances, classification and distribution of elements in
  the earth system (lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and meteorites)
* Dispersion of elements - primary and secondary dispersion patterns.
* Geochemical environments (surficial and deep-seated).
* Geochemistry of igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.
* Isotope Geochemistry (stable isotope fraction (H, O, N, S, C)) and the delta notation.
* Application of stable isotopes in geological science.
* Radiactive isotope, (the radiactive decay series of U, Th and K).
Application of radioactive isotopes in geo-technology.

### Definition
Geochemistry essentially deals with how elements are distributed in minerals and rocks,
as well as the effects (consequences) of that distribution, in different physical-chemical
environments.
