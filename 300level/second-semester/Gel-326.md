# Paleobiology
In the study of life from the past, like a crime scene investigation, there are clues here and there, and
paleontologists can use these to understand something about an accident plant or animal or a whole fauna or 
flora (the animals or plants that lived together in one place at one time).

# Evolution
The basic concept of evolution states that all organisms have arisen from preexisting living things through
a gradual process of change over a long time.

This means that organisms of today, merely represent the product of change over a long period.
Evolution can also be considered the total of adaptive changes that organisms have undergone over the years.
It leads to the development of new species from earlier ones.

## Historical Development of Evolution
1. Linneaus Work:
In 1737 Linneaus in his book Systema Naturae attempted to classify all living creatures into logical systems.
He used two names for this the genus name and the species. His work mainly serves to show that there are degrees of variation between creatures and not just random differences.
2. Lamarck's Work:
In 1809 Chevalier de Lamarck published the theory of evolution, with which he brought many ideas such as
adaptation and that creatures need to be efficiently adapted to its environment. He also brought felt that
these adaptations were taking place as a consequence of need.
3. Cuvier's Work:
Cuvier is best known for his work on the "law of correlation," which states that an organism's structure is closely related to its function, and for his development of the idea of catastrophism, which posits that sudden, violent events have played a major role in shaping the Earth's geological history. He also proposed that species could go extinct, which was a controversial idea at the time. Cuvier's work played a key role in the development of the modern understanding of evolution.
