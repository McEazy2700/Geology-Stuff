# Metamorphic Petrology

**Metamorphism** is the change that takes place within a body of rock as a result of it being
subjected to high temperature and/or high pressure.  
The **parent rock or `Protolith`** is the rock that exists before metamorphism starts.
New metamorphic rocks can be formed from old ones as temperature and pressure increase.
* Metamorphic rocks form under temperatures that are higher than those experienced by
    sedimentary rocks, but less than those that cause igneous rocks to melt.
* Given that pressure and water content affect the temperature at which rocks melt, 
    metamorphism can occur at higher temperatures for some kinds of rocks, whereas others
    begin to melt under these same conditions.
* Metamorphic rocks can have very different mineral assemblages and textures than their 
    parent rock, but their overall chemical composition doesn't change very much.

> Shale is is the parent form of _Slate_, _Schist_, _Gneis (pronounced **"nice"**)_ and _Magnetite_.
    They might look different, but Magnetite is formed when the atoms of Shale are re-arranged to the
    required mineral structure, as is the case with everything in between.

### Controls on Metamorphism
The main factors that control metamorphic processes are:
* The Chemical composition of the parent rock.
* The temperature under which the metamorphism takes place.
* The pressure applied, and whether the pressure is equal in all directions or not.
* The amount and type of fluid (usually water) that is present during metamorphism.
* The amount of time over which metamorphic conditions are sustained.

##### Mineral Composition
Parent rocks can be any of the three types (Sedimentary, Igneous, or Metamorphic), however it's their
    chemical or mineral composition that is really the determinant factor. This is because, the stability
    of minerals and how they are influenced by changing conditions is what determines which minerals
    will form as metamorphism occurs. Some minerals might undergo chemical reactions and turn into new
    minerals, while others will just change their shape and size.

##### Temperature
The temperature under which metamorphism occurs is a key variable in determining which metamorphic processes
    occur. Mineral stability is highly dependent on the temperature, pressure, and the presence of fluid.
    Most mineral are only stable over a range of temperatures. Quartz for example is stable from surface temperatures
    up to 1800°C. However, if the pressure is higher, that upper limit will also be higher, but if fluids are
    present, the upper limit will be lower. Most other minerals have upper limits between 150°C and 1000°C.  
Quartz has different `Polymorphs` that are stable between 0°C and 1800°C. The minerals _kyanite_, _andaulsit_, and
    _sillimanite_ are polymorphs of quartz with the composition Al<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub>.The fact that they are
    stable at different temperatures means that their presence can be used to determine the temperatures and
    pressures experienced by the rock containing one or more of the polymorphs.
> **Polymorphism**: literally means _"many forms"_

> In crystallography or mineralogy, it generally means that one mineral can exist in various crystal forms under
    certain conditions (usually temperature and pressure). These forms are called `Polymorphs`.
