# Metamorphic Petrology

**Metamorphism** is the change that takes place within a body of rock as a result of it being
subjected to high temperature and/or high presure.  
The **parent rock or `Protolith`** is the rock that exists before metamorphism starts.
New metamorphic rocks can be formed from old ones as temperature and pressure increase.
* Metamorphic rocks form under temperatures that are higher than those experienced by
    sedimentary rocks, but less than those that cause igneous rocks to melt.
* Given that presure and water content affect the temperature at which rocks melt, 
    metamorphism can occur at higher temperatures for some kind of rocks, whereas others
    begin to melt under these same conditions.
* Metamorphic rocks can have very different mineral assemblages and textures than their 
    parent rock, but their overall chemical composition doesn't change very much.
