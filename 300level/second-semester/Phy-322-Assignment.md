## Answers
### 1. Give all possible definitions of Crystal that you know.
  * A crystal or crystalline solid is a solid material whose constituents (such as atoms, molecules, or ions)
    are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure, forming a crystal lattice that extends in all directions.
  * A crystal is a solid material in which atoms, ions and molecules are arranged in regularly repeating pattern
     that extends in all three spatial dimensions,
  * A crystal is any solid crystalline substance, and thus has a regular and ordered internal arrangement of
     atoms, ions or molecules.
  * A crystal is a solid substance that is composed of atoms, ions, and molecules that are arranged in a regular
      geometric pattern.
    In general, "crystal" is used to describe materials that have a regular repeating and symmetrical atomic structure

### 2. Give two definitions of amorphous materials.
  * An amorphous material is a solid material that lacks long-range order in its atomic structure.
  * A solid in which the constituent particles do possess regular three-dimensional arrangement.
  * An amorphous material can also be defined as a solid that has a somewhat random internal arrangement of atoms,
     ions and molecules, which gives them a glassy appearance.
  Examples of amorphous solids include glass, plastics, and many types of rubber.

### 3. Give three definitions of a lattice.
  * A lattice is a regularly repeating arrangement of points in three-dimensional space, that is usually occupied by
     atoms, ions or molecules.
  * A lattice can also be defined as a three-dimensional array of points that form a regular and repeating pattern.

  * A set of mathematical points to which the crystal is attached.

### 4. Give two definitions of Bravais lattice.
  * A Bravais Lattice is an array of discrete points that look the same in all directions and orientations that look
    the same in all directions.

  * A Bravais Lattice is the basic building block from which all crystals can be constructed.

### 5. Define what is meant by basic/basis cell.
A basic cell or basis cell is the smallest unit cell that can be used to construct the entire crystal lattice without
gaps or overlaps. It is a three-dimensional structure that is repeated in a crystal lattice to
create the overall crystal structure. The basic cell is characterized by the lengths of its sides and the angles between
them, and it is used to define the fundamental geometry of the crystal lattice. The arrangement of atoms within the basic
cell determines the overall properties of the crystal, such as its hardness, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity.

### 6. List two definitions of the primitive unit cell.
  * A primitive unit cell is a basic building block of a crystal lattice. It is the smallest unit cell that can be used
    to construct the entire crystal lattice without gaps or overlaps.
  * A primitive unit cell is a three-dimensional structure that is repeated in a crystal lattice to create the overall
    crystal structure. It is the smallest unit cell that can be used to construct the entire crystal lattice without
    gaps or overlaps, and it is characterized by the lengths of its sides and the angles between them.

### 10. Calculate the atomic packing fraction of
  * Hexagonal Crystal lattice
  * Hexagonal-Closed Packed structure

#### Hexagonal-Closed Packed structure
  the packing fraction of a Hexagonal-Closed Packed structure is given by  
  $$ PF = \frac{volume\ occupied\ by\ the\ atoms}{volume\ of\ the\ unit\ cell}$$
  $$ volume\ occupied\ by\ the\ atoms = z \times volume of an atom$$
