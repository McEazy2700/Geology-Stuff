## Answers
### 1. Give all possible definitions of Crystal that you know.
  * A crystal or crystalline solid is a solid material whose constituents (such as atoms, molecules, or ions)
    are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure, forming a crystal lattice that extends in all directions.
  * A crystal is a solid material in which atoms, ions and molecules are arranged in regularly repeating pattern
     that extends in all three spatial dimensions,
  * A crystal is any solid crystalline substance, and thus has a regular and ordered internal arrangement of
     atoms, ions or molecules.
  * A crystal is a solid substance that is composed of atoms, ions, and molecules that are arranged in a regular
      geometric pattern.
    In general, "crystal" is used to describe materials that have a regular repeating and symmetrical atomic structure

### 2. Give two definitions of amorphous materials.
  * An amorphous material is a solid material that lacks long-range order in its atomic structure.
  * A solid in which the constituent particles do possess a regular three-dimensional arrangement.
  * An amorphous material can also be defined as a solid that has a somewhat random internal arrangement of atoms,
     ions and molecules, which gives them a glassy appearance.
  Examples of amorphous solids include glass, plastics, and many types of rubber.

### 3. Give three definitions of a lattice.
  * A lattice is a regularly repeating arrangement of points in three-dimensional space, that is usually occupied by
     atoms, ions or molecules.
  * A lattice can also be defined as a three-dimensional array of points that form a regular and repeating pattern.

### 4. Give two definitions of Bravais lattice.
  * A Bravais Lattice is an array of discrete points that look the same in all directions and orientations that look
    the same in all directions.  
   _**Reference** [byjus.com](https://byjus.com/chemistry/bravais-lattice/)_
  * A Bravais Lattice is the basic building block from which all crystals can be constructed.

### 5. Define what is meant by basic/basis cell.
A basic cell or basis cell is the smallest unit cell that can be used to construct the entire crystal lattice without
gaps or overlaps. It is a three-dimensional structure that is repeated in a crystal lattice to
create the overall crystal structure. The basic cell is characterized by the lengths of its sides and the angles between
them, and it is used to define the fundamental geometry of the crystal lattice. The arrangement of atoms within the basic
cell determines the overall properties of the crystal, such as its hardness, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity.

### 6. List two definitions of the primitive unit cell.
  * A primitive unit cell is a basic building block of a crystal lattice. It is the smallest unit cell that can be used
    to construct the entire crystal lattice without gaps or overlaps.
  * A primitive unit cell is a three-dimensional structure that is repeated in a crystal lattice to create the overall
    crystal structure. It is the smallest unit cell that can be used to construct the entire crystal lattice without
    gaps or overlaps, and it is characterized by the lengths of its sides and the angles between them.

### 7. Draw the basic vector that represents the primitive unit cell in the following 3D order
* Body-Centered Cubic (BCC)  
![Body-Centered Cubic lattice](./images/403px-Lattice_body_centered_cubic.png)  

* Face-Centered Cubic (FCC)

* Hexagonal-Closed Packed (HCP)  
![Hexagonal-Closed Packed lattice(./images/Hexagonal,_close_packed_crystal_lattice.png)


### 8. Give full atomic coordinates of the Cesium Chloride (CsCl) structure.
Cesium chloride (CsCl) has a Body-Centered structure.
![Sodium Chloride](./images/cesium-chlorid.jpg)
* It has two primitive cells in a cubic unit and each unit cell has two molecule basis of CsCl.
* The position of the Cl ion is at (0 0 0) and the Cs ion is at ($\frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{2}$)
* The Cs are situated at the body center and the eight Cl ions are at the corner of the unit cell. Similarly,
  if we extend the unit cell we can see a Cl ion is surrounded by 8 Cs ions. Thus the coordinate number of CsCl is 8.

### 9. Derive the atomic coordinates of the HCP structure other than the method used in class.
![HCP Showing Coordination number](./images/HCP_Coordination-number.png)  
From the above diagram, we can see that the Hexagonal-Closed Packed structure has a Coordination number of twelve(12).

### 10. Calculate the atomic packing fraction of
  * Hexagonal Crystal lattice
  * Hexagonal-Closed Packed structure

#### Hexagonal-Closed Packed structure
Consider the diagram bellow  
![Hexagonal-Closed Packed lattice](./images/Hexagonal,_close_packed_crystal_lattice.png)  
From the diagram above we notice that each atom at the edge of the hexagon is shared between six cells
![HCP Diagram showing sharing of edge atoms](./images/Lattice-sharing-of-atom-HCP.png)  
* 3 cells at the top
* 3 cells at the bottom  
$-$ each of the 12 edge atoms contributes a total of $\frac{1}{6}$ atoms to the cell  
$$\frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2\ (for\ the\ edge\ atoms)$$
$-$ we can also see that each of the face atoms is being shared between two adjacent unit cells, thus the two face atoms
(at the top and the bottom), contribute a total of $\frac{1}{2}$ atoms.
$$\frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1\ (for\ the\ face\ atoms)$$
$-$ we also see that the three inner atoms are not shared with any other unit cell and thus contribute a full atom each to the
unit cell
$$1 \times 3 = 3\ (for\ the\ inner\ atoms)$$
this means the effective number of atoms $z$ in HCP is 
$$2 + 1 + 3 = 6atoms$$

#### Packing Fraction
  the packing fraction of a Hexagonal-Closed Packed structure is given by  
  $$ PF = \frac{volume\ occupied\ by\ the\ atoms}{volume\ of\ the\ unit\ cell}$$
- Solving for the volume occupied by the atoms in the cell  
 the total volume $v_a$ occupied by atoms in a unit cell is given by
 $$ v_a = z \times volume\ of\ an\ atom$$  
 where $z$ is the effective number of atoms in the cell  
 and $v_a$ is the total volume occupied by atoms in a unit cell  
  $$ v_a = 6 \times \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$$
- Solving for the volume of the unit cell

the volume of the unit cell $v_u$ for HCP is given by  
$$ v_u = area\ of\ the\ base \times height(C)$$
- calculating the area of the base hexagon
consider the hexagon bellow
![A hexagon divided into equilateral triangles](./images/hexagon-base.png)  
from the above diagram, we can see that six equilateral triangles make up the hexagons, therefore the area of one triangle
multiplied by 6 will give us the area of the hexagon
the area of a triangle is $\frac{1}{2}base \times h$
![Closed packed triangle](./images/closed-packed-triangle.png)
from the diagram above, the distance between two touching atoms $a = 2r$  
using pythagoras theorem we can solve for the height of the triangle  
$$a^2 = (\frac{1}{2}a)^2 \times h^2$$
$$h = \frac{a\sqrt{3}}{4}$$
thus the area of the triangle $A$ is  
$$ A = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times (\frac{1}{2}a)^2 \times h^2$$
$$ = \frac{\sqrt{3}a^2}{4}$$
multiplied by 6, the area of the hexagon $A_h$ is
$$ A_h = \frac{3\sqrt{3}a^2}{2}$$
the volume of HCP = $A_h \times C$
whre $C$ is the height of the HCP lattice  
$$C = \frac{4r\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3}}$$ 

$$\therefore PF = \frac{6 \times \frac{4}{3}\pi \times (\frac{a}{3})^3}{\frac{3a^2\sqrt{3}}{2} \times C}$$
$$the\ atomic\ packing\ fraction\ PF = 0.75$$
$$the\ atomic\ packing\ percentage\ = 75\%$$

### 11. Given the basic vector of Body-Centered Cubic lattice in real space with the expression.  
  $$a1 = \frac{a}{2}x + \frac{a}{2}y - \frac{a}{2}z$$
  $$a2 = -\frac{a}{2}x + \frac{a}{2}y + \frac{a}{2}z$$
  $$a3 = \frac{a}{2}x - \frac{a}{2}y + \frac{a}{2}z$$

#### I. Determine the reciprocal lattice vectors.
![BCC reciprocal lattice](./images/bcc-reciprocal-lattice.png)  
The Reciprocal lattice of BCC are given by:
$$
\vec a_1 = \frac{2\pi(\vec a_2 \times \vec a_3)}{\vec a_1 \cdot (\vec a_2 \times \vec a_3)}
\ \ \vec a_2 = \frac{2\pi(\vec a_3 \times \vec a_1)}{\vec a_1 \cdot (\vec a_2 \times \vec a_3)}
\ \ \vec a_3 = \frac{2\pi(\vec a_1 \times \vec a_2)}{\vec a_1 \cdot (\vec a_2 \times \vec a_3)}
$$
$$ \vec a_2 \times \vec a_3 = \frac{a}{2}(-\hat x -\hat y + \hat z) \times \frac{a}{2}(\hat x - \hat y + \hat z)$$
$$ = \frac{a^2}{4}\begin{bmatrix}
\hat x & \hat y & \hat z \\
-1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & -1 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \
= \frac{a^2}{4}\cdot \hat x\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1\\ -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
-\hat y\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
+\hat x\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$
$$ \vec a_2 \times \vec a_3 = \frac{a^3}{4}\cdot \hat x(1 + 1) -\hat y(-1 -1) + \hat z(1 - 1)$$
$$ = \frac{a^2}{4}\cdot 2\hat x + 2\hat y\ \ \  = \frac{a^2}{x}\cdot 2(\hat x + \hat y) \ \ \ =\frac{a^2}{2}(\hat x + \hat y)$$

---
$$ \therefore \vec a_2 \times \vec a_3 = \frac{a^2}{2}(\hat x + \hat y)$$
---

$$ \vec a_1 \cdot (\vec a_2 \times a_3) = \frac{a}{2}(\hat x + \hat y - \hat z) \cdot \frac{a^2}{2}(\hat x + \hat y)$$
$$ = \frac{a^3}{4}(\hat x \cdot \hat x + \hat y \cdot \hat y) \ \ \ = \frac{a^3}{4}(1 + 1) \ \ \ = \frac{a^3}{4}(2) \ \ \ = \frac{a^3}{2}$$

---
$$ \therefore \vec a_1 \cdot (\vec a_2 \times \vec a_3) = \frac{a^3}{2}$$  
---

$$ \vec a_3 \times \vec a_1 = \frac{a}{2}(\hat x - \hat y + \hat z) \times \frac{a}{2}(\hat x + \hat y - \hat z)$$
$$ = \frac{a^2}{4}(\hat x - \hat y + \hat z) \times (\hat x + \hat y - \hat z)$$
$$ = \frac{a^2}{4}
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat x & \hat y & \hat z \\
1 & -1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\ \ = \frac{a^2}{4} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
\vec x \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
-\vec y \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1  \end{bmatrix}
+\vec z \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$$
\vec a_3 \times \vec a_1 = \frac{a^2}{4} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} \hat x(1 -1) -\hat y(-1-1) + \hat z(1 + 1) \end{bmatrix}
$$
$$ = \frac{a^2}{4} \cdot  \begin{bmatrix} \hat x(0) -\hat y(-2) + \hat z(2) \end{bmatrix}$$
$$
= \frac{a^2}{4} \cdot 2\hat y + 2\hat z
\ \ = \frac{a^3}{4} \cdot 2(\hat y + \hat z)
\ \ = \frac{a^3}{2}(\hat y + \hat z)
$$

---
$$ \therefore \vec a_3 \times \vec a_1 = \frac{a^2}{2}(\vec y + \vec z)$$
---

$$ \vec a_1 \times \vec a_2 = \frac{a}{2}(\hat x + \hat y + \hat z) \times \frac{a}{2}(-\hat x + \hat y + \hat z)$$
$$ = \frac{a^2}{4}(\hat x + \hat y -\hat z) \times (-\hat x + \hat y + \hat z)$$
$$
= \frac{a^2}{4}
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat x & \hat y & \hat z \\
1 & 1 & -1 \\
-1 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\ \ \ = \frac{a^2}{4}
\cdot \begin{bmatrix}
\hat x\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ 1 & 1  \end{bmatrix}
-\hat y \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
+\hat z \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$$
\vec a_1 \times \vec a_2  = \frac{a^2}{4}
\cdot \begin{bmatrix}
\hat x(1 + 1) -\hat y(1 - 1) + \hat z(1 + 1)
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$$
= \frac{a^2}{4}\begin{bmatrix} 2\vec x + 2\vec z \end{bmatrix}
\ \ = \frac{a^2}{4}\cdot 2(\hat x + \hat z)
\ \ = \frac{a^2}{2}\cdot (\hat x + \hat z)
$$

---
$$\therefore \vec a_1 \times \vec a_2 \ = \frac{a^2}{2}(\hat x + \hat y)$$
---
#### The reciprocal lattice of BCC are
$$\vec a_1 = \frac{2\pi(\vec a_2 \times \vec a_3)}{a_1\cdot (\vec a_2 \times \vec a_3)}
\ \ \ = \frac{2\pi\cdot \frac{a^2}{2}(\hat x + \hat y)}{\frac{a^3}{2}}
\ \ \ = \frac{\pi a^3(\hat x + \hat y)}{\frac{a^3}{2}}
\ \ \ = \frac{2\pi}{a}(\hat x + \hat y)
$$
$$\vec a_2 = \frac{2\pi(\vec a_3 \times \vec a_1)}{a_1\cdot (\vec a_2 \times \vec a_3)}
\ \ \ = \frac{2\pi\cdot \frac{a^2}{2}(\hat y + \hat z)}{\frac{a^3}{2}}
\ \ \ = \frac{\pi a^3(\hat y + \hat z)}{\frac{a^3}{2}}
\ \ \ = \frac{2\pi}{a}(\hat y + \hat z)
$$
$$\vec a_2 = \frac{2\pi(\vec a_1 \times \vec a_2)}{a_1\cdot (\vec a_2 \times \vec a_3)}
\ \ \ = \frac{2\pi\cdot \frac{a^2}{2}(\hat x + \hat z)}{\frac{a^3}{2}}
\ \ \ = \frac{\pi a^3(\hat x + \hat z)}{\frac{a^3}{2}}
\ \ \ = \frac{2\pi}{a}(\hat x + \hat z)
$$
