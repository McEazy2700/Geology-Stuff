##### What is Solid State Physics?
Solid state physics it the study of solids, through various methods like crystallography, quantum physics, electromagnetism and metallurgy.
> **Crystallography** is a branch of science that deals with the arrangement, and bonding in atoms and the geometry of it's crystal lattice.
