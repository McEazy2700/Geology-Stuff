##### What is Solid State Physics?
Solid state physics it the study of solids, through various methods like crystallography, quantum physics, electromagnetism and metallurgy.
> **Crystallography** is a branch of science that deals with the arrangement, and bonding in atoms and the geometry of it's crystal lattice.

##### Crystal Structure
Crystal structure refers to the ordered arrangement of atoms, ions and molecules. This structure occurs from the inner nature of constituent
particles to products symmetric patterns. The complete structure is made up of repeating unit cells.

> A Unit cell is the smallest volume which when repeated in all directions, gives the rise to the crystal structure. Thus a crystal is formed
from a periodic repetition of identical structural units (Unit cells) in space. The Unit cell is the building block of the crystal structure.
