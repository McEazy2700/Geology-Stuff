## What is Solid State Physics?

Solid-state physics is the study of solids, through various methods like
crystallography, quantum physics, electromagnetism and metallurgy.

> **Crystallography** is a branch of science that deals with the arrangement,
> and bonding in atoms and the geometry of it's crystal lattice.

## Crystal Structure

A crystal is a material that possesses a regular and repeating internal arrangement
of particles. Materials with this ordered internal arrangement of particles are
said to be Crystalline. While other materials that don't possess this regularly
repeating internal arrangement of particles are said to be Amorphous.

Crystal structure refers to the ordered arrangement of atoms, ions and molecules.
This structure occurs from the inherent nature of constituent particles to produce
symmetric patterns. The complete structure is made up of repeating unit cells.

> A Crystal is defined as a periodic array of particles (atoms or molecules).
> A Unit cell is the smallest volume which when repeated in all directions,
> gives rise to the crystal structure. Thus a crystal is formed from a
> periodic repetition of identical structural units (Unit cells) in space.
> The Unit cell is the building block of the crystal structure.

The reason crystals are formed, by the repeating arrangement of unit cells is that
nature tends to want to arrange particles as efficiently as possible in space.
This can be observed through a lattice observation technique.

Bravais determined that there are only three lattices that follow a cubic pattern.
They are the Simple Cubic, Body Centered Cubic, and Face Centered Cubic lattices.

### Methods of differentiating Bravais lattices

1. Coordination Number (Nearest neighbors): A good way to differentiate these
   Cubic lattices is to look at the number of nearest neighbors to a reference
   particle. This number is known as the coordination number of that crystal structure.

2. The Packing (Maximum packing): You can think about it like this. Put something
   at each of the lattice points, and grow them till they can't grow anymore and
   are touching each other. In this case, we're taking spheres, because that's how
   we're trying to represent atoms.

3. Close-packed direction: This refers to the directions in which atoms or
   particles touch.

### Simple Cubic

- Coordination number (Nearest neighbors): Consider the Simple Cubic crystal
  below: You might be able to notice that if you take any particle at any spot
  in the cube, it should have 6 nearest neighbors. The neighbors at the top and
  bottom, at the left and the right, and the front and the back.

- Packing (Maximum packing): If we consider the packed cubic image above, assuming
  all sides (lattices) of the cubic structure have a length of `a`, and that each
  atom is fully packed, then each atom in the cell, will have a radius of half the
  lattice ($\frac{1}{2}a$).
  Now since the volume of a sphere is $v = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^{2}$,  
  Then substituting ($\frac{1}{2}a$) for $r$, the volume of a sphere in the cell
  is  
  $$v = \frac{4}{3}\pi(\frac{1}{2}a)^{2}$$
  At maximum packing (important)
  From this point we can then calculate the Atomic Packing Fraction or Filling
  Fraction (FF) to be the (volume of atom in a cell divided by the volume of the
  cell) multiplied by the number of atoms in the cell (say `n`).  
  $$FF = (\frac{V_{atoms}}{V_{cell}})n$$  
  In a simple cubic lattice, the APF of FF is $\frac{\pi}{6} = 52\%$. This is
  considered to be quite an inefficient method of packing so much so that only
  one element in the periodic table is arranged in this lattice, and that's
  Polonium `Po`.

- Close-packed direction: For a simple-cubic cell this is the cube edge since this
  is where fully grown particles touch.

- Note: Every atom or particle in a simple-cubic crystals unit cell is shared
  with 7 other neighboring cells to make a total of 8. Thus each cell only
  processes $\frac{1}{8}th$ of an atom or a particle. So when you add up all
  the fractions of atoms in a simple-cubic unit cell you get a total of 1 atom.

#### Properties of simple-cubic lattice

1. 6 nearest neighbors (NN).
2. Atomic Packing Fraction (Filling Fraction) of $53\%$
3. Total of 1 atom in the cell.
4. Only Polonium possesses this crystal structure.

### Body-Centered Cubic

![body-centered cubic crystal](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/bodycentered-cubic-unit-cell-crystal-260nw-347363216.jpg)

- Coordination number: In a body-centered cubic crystal as you might be able to
  observe from the central diagram in the image above, the central particle has
  8 other particles nearest to itself.
  So the coordination number of a body-centered cubic crystal is 8.

- Close-packed direction: Also from the image above, the diagram on the right
  shows the particles making contact with the central particle (which is diagonal)
  before adjacent particles.
  This shows that the body-centered cubic cell has a **diagonal close-packed direction.**
