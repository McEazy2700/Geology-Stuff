# Solid State Physics (Kittle)
According to Kittle, a crystal is formed by the infinite repitition of groups of atoms.
For some reason, he calls one of these groups **basis**, I thought it was the **unit cell**.  

## What the Heck is Basis, Unit cell, lattice
I'll say the **basis** or the **unit-cell** is the smallest collection of atoms, molecules or ions
that can be repeated in three dimensions to form the whole crystal.  
Lattice on the other hand is a set of mathematical points (abstract locations in space) where the
where those atoms that form on the basis can be found. In other word, the **basis** sits on the
**lattice**.
