# Remote Sensing

Remote sensing is a general name referring to all methods of collecting data about an object without making physical contact with that object
(at some distance from the object of study), by some kind of recording device.  
According to the above definition, a pair of binoculars and an ordinary camera are simple remote sensing systems.  
During World War II, two new remote sensing methods were developed, sonar and radar.  

Remote sensing systems are divided into two based on their separate technical solution. **Passive (Optical) remote sensing systems** measure
existing radiation, such as reflected solar radiation from the earth's surface. **Active remote (Satellite) sensing systems** emit radiation (micro and radio waves) on the object and measure the amount of reflected radiation.  

Satellite remote sensing refers to all methods of getting information about an object from a distance by measuring the radiation emitted, or 
reflected or absorbed by the object.

An ordinary camera is an example of a passive remote sensing system, using existing light as an input. If a flash is added to the camera,
it becomes an active remote-sensing system, since it then provides the necessary radiation, without considering existing radiation sources.  

#### Elements of remote sensing
* Energy source or Illumination.
* Radiation and the atmosphere.
* Interaction with the object.
* Recording of energy/data by the sensor.
* Transmission, Reception and processing.
* Interpretation and processing.
* Application.

Examples of active remote sensing systems are Radar, Sonar, Echo-location and more recently Lidar which uses laser technology to emit and then
collect reflection from the surface of the target object(Earth). Examples of passive remote-sensing systems include Photography, Scanning
Mirrors (MSS), and Push Broom Scanner.

> Active remote sensing uses micro and radio waves because of their larger wavelengths, which allows them to obstacles such as the clouds and 
small vegetation, which is are often limitation of Optical remote sensing.

#### The Physical Foundation of remote sensing
Most remote sensing is done by collecting data from some kind of Electromagnetic radiation. So we study the properties of such radiation.  

    c = v.λ
    where:  
    c is the speed of light,
    v is the frequency of the wave,
    and λ is the wavelength of the wave
as **c** is fairly constant, the wavelength and frequency are inversely related.  

In remote sensing applications, the electromagnetic energy is usually classified according to it's location in the electromagnetic spectrum 
that is by it's wavelength.

At the lower-end (shorter wavelength and higher frequency) we have **Gamma rays**, while at the higher-end (longer wavelength and lower 
frequency) we have **Radio waves**.
> In remote sensing, we are more concerned with wavelength than frequency. The most common unit for measuring wavelength is the 
micrometer (μm) which is 10<sup>-6</sup>m, but the ISO (International system unit) is nanometer which is 10<sup>-9</sup>

##### 3 Broad Categories of Remote Sensing Platforms
* Ground based remote sensing.
* Airborne remote sensing.
* Satellite based remote sensing
> I'll say that any of the kinds or remote sensing (Active remote sensing and Passive remote sensing), can fall into any of these categories.
