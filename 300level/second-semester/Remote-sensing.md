# Remote Sensing

Remote sensing is a general name referring to all methods of collecting data about an object without making physical contact with that object
(at some distance from the object of study), by some kind of recording device.  
According to the above definition, a pair of binoculars and an ordinary camera are simple remote sensing systems.  
During World War II, two new remote sensing methods were developed, the sonar and the radar.  

Remote sensing systems are divided into two based on their separate technical solution. **Passive remote sensing systems** measure existing
radiation, such as reflected solar radiation from the earth's surface. **Active remote sensing systems** emit radiation on the object
and measure the amount of reflected radiation.  

An ordinary camera is an example of a passive remote sensing system, using existing light as an input. If a flash is added to the camera,
it becomes an active remote-sensing system, since it then provides the necessary radiation, without considering existing radiation sources.  

Examples of active remote sensing systems are Radar, Sonar, Echo-sounder and more recently Lidar which uses laser technology to emit and then
collect reflection from the surface of the target object(Earth). Examples of passive remote-sensing systems include Photography, Scanning
Mirrors (MSS), and Push Broom Scanner.

#### The Physical Foundation of remote sensing
Most remote sensing is done by collecting data from some kind of Electromagnetic radiation. So we study the properties of such radiation.  

    c = v.λ
    where:  
    c is the speed of light,
    v is the frequency of the wave,
    and λ is the wavelength of the wave
as **c** is fairly constant, the wavelength and frequency are related inversely.  

In remote sensing applications, the electromagnetic energy is usually classified according to it's location in the electromagnetic spectrum
